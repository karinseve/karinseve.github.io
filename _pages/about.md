I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Heriot-Watt University and University of Edinburgh, funded by the [Edinburgh Centre for Robotics](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/).     
I work in the Interaction Lab ([iLab](https://sites.google.com/site/hwinteractionlab/)) group under the supervision of [Verena Rieser](https://sites.google.com/site/verenateresarieser/) and [Yannis Konstas](http://www.ikonstas.net/).     
I am working on Knowledge-Grounded Open-Domain Dialogue, more specifically I explore how to transition between topics in a conversation without being abrupt.
